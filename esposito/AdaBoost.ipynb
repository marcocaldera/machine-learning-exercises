    "1. Write a weak learner to be used with the AdaBoost algorithm you just wrote. The weak learner that you will implement is the most inaccurate weak learner possible: it basically works by extracting a linear model at random and trying to use that model to classify the examples. Being extracted at random the models it generates do not guarantee that the weighted error $\\epsilon_t$ is smaller than $0.5$. The algorithm solves this problem by flipping the decisions whenever it finds out that $\\epsilon_t > 0.5$ (i.e., if the weighted error is larger than $0.5$ it reverses the sign of all the weights so that the decision surface stays the same, but the regions where it predicts $+1$ and $-1$ are reversed).\n",
